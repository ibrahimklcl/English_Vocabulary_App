# English Vocabulary Learning App

A modern and simple desktop application built with Python to help master technical English 
vocabulary. I developed this project to make my own language learning process more organized and efficient while working on engineering projects.

## Why I Built This?
Learning technical terms in the aerospace and electronics industry can be challenging. I created this tool to:

* Create my own custom dictionary of engineering terms.
* Track my progress and identify which words I need to study more.
* Practice with a clean, distraction-free interface.

## Features
* **Modern Interface: A user-friendly GUI with Dark/Light mode support.

* **Progress Tracking: The app remembers your correct and incorrect answers even after you close it.

* **Smart Review: It automatically re-asks the words you missed until you learn them.

* **Easy to Update: You can add new words simply by editing the words.txt file.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required library: pip install customtkinter.
3. Run the script: python ingilizce_kelime_uygulamasi.py.
